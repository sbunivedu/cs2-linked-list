# Linked List

We will develop a LinkedList class using the Test-Driven Development(TDD)
approach.

The LinearNode class is provided and we will use it as the internal storage for
the LinkedList.

The LinkedList calss is partially implemented with the following methods already
defined: ```first```, ```last```, ```contains```, ```isEmpty```, ```size```,
and ```toString```. Study those methods to understand how they work.

We will implement the following mutator/setter methods: ```addToFront```,
```addToRear```, ```addAfter```, ```removeFirst```, ```removeLast```, and
```remove```.
