# Linked List

We will develop a LinkedList class using the Test-Driven Development(TDD)
approach.

The LinearNode class is provided and we will use it as the internal storage for
the LinkedList.

The LinkedList calss is partially implemented with the following methods already
defined: ```first```, ```last```, ```contains```, ```isEmpty```, ```size```,
and ```toString```. Study those methods to understand how they work.

We will implement the following mutator/setter methods: ```addToFront```,
```addToRear```, ```addAfter```, ```removeFirst```, ```removeLast```, and
```remove```.

## Workflow
To use [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) we will
adhere to the following workflow:
1. add a new test.
2. compile the code base and run the tests to watch the new test fail.
```
javac *.java
java LinkedListTester
```
3. write just enough code to make the test pass.
4. repeat till all methods are implemented.

## Steps
### test and code ```addToFront```
### test and code ```addToRear```
### test and code ```addAfter```
### test and code ```removeFirst```
### test and code ```removeLast```
### test and code ```remove```
